![Thanasis Polychronakis](/assets/img/thanpolas-about.jpg) Hi! My name is Thanasis Polychronakis, I have been working with startups and Internet based companies for over 20 years. As a CTO in many of them I have created engineering procedures and workflows to speed up and ensure the quality of the product produced. I've grown teams through my network and by [running robust hiring campaigns](http://thanpol.as/hiring/hiring-senior-engineers). I just love the startup game!

Through my course I have contributed to a lot of open source projects that are the pylars of our industry and have created quite a few myself. I organized the [local Node.JS meetup](https://www.meetup.com/Thessaloniki-Node-js-Meetup/) back in my hometown and founded [skgtech.io](http://skgtech.io), a team that helped ignite the local tech meetup scene back in 2014. As a result of my community involvement I started and organized the [DEVit Conference](http://devitconf.org) for three years, up until I had to move to London and pass on the leadership to the community.![coding weapons](/assets/img/coding-weapons.png)

Today I am a happy camper in London, always looking to meet exciting people and new opportunities, please don't hesitate to get in touch!
